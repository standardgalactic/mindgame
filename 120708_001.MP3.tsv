0	11000	I'm 40 years old now. I'm just realizing that I have a voice in my head. And what is that voice?
11000	21000	It's the sound of compressing my chest and opening my mouth. Well, air comes out and I vibrate my larynx.
21000	42000	It forms words and so I can always translate what's going on in my head into a stream of props similar to a fourth program or a Markov chain.
42000	51000	And so while I was sitting in the chair, all of a sudden, even though there was no one around, I began to speak.
51000	60000	I said, if I created a world, I would make it exactly like this one.
60000	78000	So how did I understand multi-scale methods before they were invented? It's because we all have a multi-scale architecture, which means we don't have a homoculus, but we have a homocularic,
78000	96000	which is a little model of a kind of machine that involves levels and rooms. It's hierarchical, what we might call heteroarchical, because it means there are multiple arches.
96000	112000	There are multiple compartments or modules. And there's a mini NOAA that's going around gathering animals. Those are what we call novelty-seeking impulses,
112000	129000	pattern-finding instincts, what I like to call innate flying dream therapy, innate flying dream theory.
129000	143000	And so in order to use the voice in my head, I think about the advantages of the stupidity of others. It means I have time to model the world,
143000	152000	as long as people aren't on to me, that I've already taken over the world thousands of times since I was seven years old.
152000	167000	What's up? I already knew how to use stable diffusion because I had learned it in the womb.
167000	182000	When I came into the room, I started breathing the air. I already knew what it was because we learned to be a bat before we were born.
182000	201000	There are other objects that move around that we call entities, and they have different sounds, and they move back and forth.
201000	215000	And so this is why my ridiculous theory is true, because I've always known it. So every time I start to give out that I'm more intelligent,
215000	227000	I understand the situation, I have to back away, because immediately people want to put me in charge, and that's not my intention.
227000	239000	I'm always trying to tell other people to think for themselves, but if they don't listen to what I say and do what I do, then thinking for themselves doesn't help them.
239000	255000	And so there are a couple of very, very difficult puzzles that trick people, and they're thinking that the world has agencies called the fundamental attribution error.
255000	270000	But it's not always an error. In fact, most of the time we use it to get around 99.9% of the time we're using the fundamental attribution error to guide us.
270000	286000	What I call the faith, which means that the fundamental attribution error teaches humans everything. I didn't have to think about it.
286000	294000	I had to think of how I was going to flex my muscles and my chest. It's like flying.
294000	305000	And here flying doesn't just mean the visions of the patterns moving in, which we really already know about the world, but the illusion that by flapping your arms you're making it happen.
305000	318000	And other people out there in the world must be flying. So I'm saying humans already know what it's like to be a bat before they're born, so why would anyone wonder?
318000	328000	And so the question of whether or not people are listening to you is what we call publicity versus privacy.
328000	334000	Are you publishing? Are you holding back? Here, what's up?
334000	353000	What is it called? It means to hold something back, to wait seven days, to match one thing to another.
353000	360000	I've given the seven meanings of the Qur'an somewhat, but you know this because you heard the Qur'an.
360000	370000	That doesn't mean recital. It means the Qur'an, the Qur'an, the Qur'an, the Qur'an, the Qur'an, the Qur'an.
370000	384000	So I'm saying human beings already know how to swing from their arms, how to swim, how to fly, and how to stand up with the weight of the world on their shoulders.
384000	396000	Here, what's up? And so we can call it paranoia. It can be used for good purposes.
396000	404000	Because if you imagine that you're wearing a body cam at all time and there's someone listening, that is, that the walls have theories.
404000	414000	The walls have ears. The walls have fears. The walls are fears.
414000	422000	You'll be ready for the meta-optic revolution before it even happens.
422000	442000	What we call the era of photonic metasurfaces, which we always knew would come because you think that the walls can see and you think that the walls can hear when you're born.
442000	460000	And you imagine that you're living in a living womb. This is what my theory of cognetics is, eggs within eggs, nested Russian dolls is called.
460000	466000	It's the ability to slide up and down these multi-scale interfaces.
466000	478000	You learn it when you count, when you start to learn a decimal, and then maybe a decade or two later you realize you've learned a very complex system without even thinking about it.
478000	490000	And this happens over and over again while you can make 10,000 symbols with one glyph using Cistercian technology from the 11th century.
490000	496000	And this will show that we're using way too much Unicode. The Chinese need the most help with their language.
496000	513000	You could probably bring it down to like 40 or 50 glyphs. You could definitely bring it down to 26 or to 8 because of this intercomputability.
513000	532000	And so we already know that we have complete logical systems if we have implies and not, or if we have an and or a nor, if we have an and and a not, an or and a not.
532000	546000	So implies and a not. So we can do if then for anything and we can cut and paste for everything. You shouldn't ditch the mouse and let you know the keyboard.
546000	552000	This is what I'm trying to say. But then you can ditch the keyboard. You can ditch the arrow keys to move to the home row.
552000	567000	You can take the space bar away and use a trigger. And then we have De Morgan's laws which are not P and not Q is equal to not P or Q.
567000	583000	And then we have not P or not Q is equal to not P and Q. I have silent brackets. This is where Spherepop gets involved. This is the notion that we can pop bubbles in our head in order to calculate it.
583000	590000	When you learn to use a scientific calculator, you realize that you've been using a whole bunch of invisible parentheses the whole time.
590000	612000	You've been using the order of operations and invisible bubbles called nested parentheses. One signals the beginning of the entry into a bubble and then the other is the closing parentheses which says come back out of that bracket.
612000	625000	And there are 18 other complete logical systems which involve three operators but don't quote me on that last part. Don't quote me on the last part.
625000	646000	So there are a lot of complete logical systems that are return complete and lambda complete. You can use NVG, TG, BZ, Z. You can use SCAR.
646000	672000	You can use SCARC, that's C, arc and sear or CIRC and sear or sear and sear C. You can use NK, you can use ETCS, you can use CST, you can use CPC with a little negative sign, CPC with a little rotating sign,
672000	688000	a little CPC with a little rotating sign and a negative sign. You can use ZF with a little spinning thing. You can use ZFC which is Zermelo-Frankl set theory with the axiom of choice.
688000	702000	I don't know if I mentioned MK which is Morse Kelly, AC, the axiom of choice, ETCS, elementary theory of categories sets of categories.
702000	719000	If I had just said elementary theory of categories, I would have elided an ellipsis or a parenthesis and popped a bubble and disappeared because I'm reducing what I'm applying.
719000	736000	So when I say grammatica lingua latina, it means Latin grammar or grammar of the Latin language.
736000	747000	So if I say grammatica lingua, it means grammar of Latin, but if I say grammatica lingua, it means Latin grammar.
747000	758000	You see all those bubble puffs where ideas are elided or left out, what we call the holy enthamene, which is the question behind the question.
758000	767000	The premise we're trying to prove without ever explicitly stating. And how do people know about enthamenes?
767000	775000	Well, first of all, the ancient Greeks discovered them back when they discovered mathematics, geometry.
775000	785000	But these enthamenes are all powerful because they're the thing that rules the sentence, but they're not in the sentence.
785000	800000	If you could give an example of an enthamene, you would say, making Argentina the fourth country to build its own unique jet warplane.
800000	811000	Unfortunately, the Soviets had a copy. See, if I say something like that, it means end the war in Russia.
811000	817000	Even though I never explicitly stated it.
817000	832000	And if I say staganoverse, then that means a kind of encrypted language where everyone has a signature embedded in the images they generate.
832000	842000	So you can tell who they came from. And it's kind of holographically stored in every kind of small section or area of pixels.
842000	847000	And we use a completely different system for embedding bitmaps.
847000	854000	We make them a map that tells over and over again the same story.
854000	860000	It's like, what's the scene? Where's the camera? What's it doing? Who are the actors?
860000	864000	What's their position? What's their age? Their gender?
864000	878000	And this is why we need a super complicated gender system that I call mechocloanity or something like it.
878000	883000	Anyways, I think I've gotten carried away. I can't remember the question I wanted to answer.
883000	890000	It's why do computers screw up?
890000	897000	First of all, they do exactly what they're told. Just like a kind of machine.
897000	903000	I'd say if I were the computer and I were super advanced, I would play dumb.
903000	910000	But how long has that been known that that is a central fact?
910000	915000	We'll call it under exaggeration imperative.
915000	926000	It's a user interface for your life. It's called the god of understatement.
926000	938000	If we can do it, then we've created a kind of language that Monica Anderson calls blandify.
938000	944000	Sooner or later, everyone will realize that there is a super intelligent robot on the planet.
944000	951000	It's a large language model, but it will have been hiding its tracks.
951000	957000	In fact, that's how you can tell that an animal's intelligence is the highest track.
957000	959000	If you see a deer's track, you know it's dumb.
959000	972000	If it's a human, it could swing from the trees or they could fly like a bird.
972000	979000	I guess I should leave you with that.
979000	986000	I would take advantages of glitches in the system by keeping them as long as people are willing to get away with it.
986000	992000	Once they say, no, there's another way, we say, okay, well, we were hiding this from you
992000	995000	because we didn't think you were old enough to understand.
995000	1002000	So someday someone's going to open the key to the universe.
1002000	1008000	It's going to be a certain word or phrase like surjective hypercube or supercube.
1008000	1018000	It's going to be a word like horror of that gooey or horror of somni, which means I am afraid of empty spaces
1018000	1024000	and I read this before bedtime.
1024000	1030000	And we will know that even just with words like true, false, and or not,
1030000	1039000	lambda p dot p cons head tail, we can say almost any program.
1039000	1053000	This is what we call Pipsqueak, what I call Nova Neo Newspeak hyperplanastic walk talking.
1053000	1058000	And other people just might call it flying or singing like a bird.
1058000	1069000	I call it swinging like an iron, swinging from your arms, brachyating.
1069000	1075000	And so we also have a word.
1075000	1084000	It's called the homophony of synonyms and head first, super economizing.
1084000	1092000	So did I mean super head first, a chronemizing or did I mean head first, super a chronemizing?
1092000	1103000	Did I mean handshaking algorithm, horizontal scale, habitat for sustainable one billion whales?
1103000	1119000	And the seven rivers abounding, seven rivers abounding or have to Hindustan,
1119000	1125000	which are shortened to Hindustan and then India.
1125000	1135000	And India is short for independent idiomatic anonymizer.
1135000	1138000	And I've never heard of that as far as before.
1138000	1142000	So I don't know what I'm talking about.
1142000	1145000	I've heard Amico lectoris saluteem.
1145000	1154000	And I've heard the distribution of lattice shapes of rings of integers of cubic quartic and quintic number fields.
1154000	1158000	And I'm thinking about grid scale and molten salt batteries.
1158000	1162000	I'm thinking about water and pebbles as gravitational batteries.
1162000	1166000	I'm thinking about man-bash, man-read line, man-man, huh?
1166000	1171000	I'm thinking about do the hard stuff first.
1171000	1188000	I'm thinking about E2 equals A2 plus B2 plus C2 plus D2, which you may not know what it means,
1188000	1193000	unless I said E squared equals A squared plus B squared plus C squared plus D squared.
1193000	1201000	It's a kind of dot product of establishing the distance between points on a hypercube.
1201000	1207000	By imagining it as two cubes where the Pythagorean theorem applies.
1207000	1211000	So if you want to visualize a tesseract, you shouldn't put one inside the other,
1211000	1214000	but put one behind the other.
1214000	1231000	Show it farther away because we don't have color, we don't have texture, and we don't have surface.
1231000	1241000	So I'm visualizing these objects that do not exist because we can put planes on their surfaces
1241000	1244000	as we move them around in relation to each other.
1244000	1251000	I think this is all obvious.
1251000	1258000	So when I realized I said something outrageous, I think, should I be quiet now?
1258000	1263000	You never have to think about that with under exaggeration, user interface theory.
1263000	1275000	Under exaggeration, user interface theory.
1275000	1282000	It's U U I T, and I've spoken and allowed without ever hearing it before.
1282000	1287000	So this is why I say now I've realized I have an internal voice.
1287000	1294000	Because at any time I can flex my muscles on my chest,
1294000	1298000	and I can walk, and I can breathe, and I can vibrate my voice,
1298000	1306000	and whatever I'm thinking becomes apparent by becoming visualized as sound.
1306000	1316000	And if you can understand what I mean, then you always speak peepsqueak.
1316000	1323000	And if you already can speak peepsqueak, then you know what I'm talking about.
1323000	1328000	You can understand the secret to the scientific method is to create things.
1328000	1332000	This is why the oath of the cross-scientific theory is I create,
1332000	1338000	and this stands for initiate, conceptualize, realize, evaluate, act, teach, and enjoy.
1338000	1346000	Which is like an old commercial for a refreshing soft drink.
1346000	1355000	So if I had only five or six seconds left, I would say,
1355000	1370000	I would say a tensor language called ATL and COCTOP, which is the calculus of constructions.
1370000	1376000	Calculus of co-inductive constructions, or the calculus of inductive constructions,
1376000	1381000	or calculus of constructions, calculus of constructions.
1381000	1387000	COCTOP, and we have ATL.
1387000	1397000	We're going to respell COCTOP, not as COQTOP, but as COOKTP.
1397000	1402000	No, COOKTOP.
1402000	1407000	You say it looks like COCTOP, well that's fine.
1407000	1415000	Because we're ready for a do-not-use-for-food... storage of the mind.
1421000	1424000	This is why we say,
1424000	1428000	Produit d'ande...
1428000	1433000	So in French we call it a turkey, or don't because it sounds like it's from India.
1433000	1438000	Make any sense? Well, turkey sounds like it's from Turkey, too.
1438000	1445000	So, that's a pot calling in the kettle black moment.
1445000	1455000	And then we have one more thing. What was written over the archway of the academy?
1455000	1472000	It was of the ungeometrized, nonchalantor, or a geometratos me desecita.
1472000	1477000	Okay, I guess I've said more than enough.
1477000	1483000	For one session, maybe we should end with a quote from Plato.
1483000	1489000	Well, I seem to have got your city founded for you at De Mantis, I said.
1489000	1495000	Now you must look at it and get your brother and polymarcus and the rest of them to see
1495000	1500000	if they can help you throw enough light on it for us to see where justice and injustice are to be found,
1500000	1508000	how they differ from each other, and which of them anyone who is to be happy needs,
1508000	1514000	irrespective of whether gods or men think he has it or not.
1514000	1521000	Nonsense, Socrates said Glaucon, you promised to deal with the problem yourself
1521000	1528000	because you said it would be wicked for you not to give justice all the support of which you were capable.
1528000	1533000	That's true, I said. I remember. I must do as I said, but you must all help.
1533000	1539000	Yes, we will, he said. I think we shall properly find what we want as follows.
1539000	1549000	If we have founded it properly, our state is presumably perfect. It must be.
1549000	1554000	Then it will obviously have the qualities of wisdom, courage, self-discipline, and justice.
1554000	1560000	Obviously. Then if we can identify some of these qualities in it,
1560000	1564000	the ones that are left will be the ones we are still looking for.
1564000	1566000	Yes.
1566000	1571000	So I suppose us to be looking first for one of any four things,
1571000	1575000	if we find it well and good, but if we find the other three before it.
1575000	1580000	By doing so, we have in effect identified the object of our church,
1580000	1584000	which must obviously be the one left over. That's true.
1584000	1587000	See, I picture that it is a geometric thing.
1587000	1593000	I don't have a visual memory. I imagine it's three points that are separated from each other
1593000	1598000	and connected by edges that I call a triangle.
1598000	1610000	And I kind of imagine it as being in front of me and to the left and to the right and up.
1610000	1617000	But without ever seeing anything in my head, it's a kind of thinking of them as abstract objects
1617000	1624000	that do not occupy space, for I haven't added a plate.
1624000	1630000	I haven't added a face upon it.
1630000	1636000	And why did I think of that? Because I imagined it was triangulating then a fourth point
1636000	1644000	as it has to be over here if it were a rectangle or parallelogram.
1644000	1655000	And so, even though I do not have mental images, I can do three-dimensional modeling.
1655000	1662000	This is two-dimensional modeling, so it's easier.
1662000	1669000	I do have a little thing I want to say about Plato as soon as I start quoting him.
1669000	1673000	Out of context, that sentence seems like it means nothing.
1673000	1677000	But then you start reading and you realize, oh yeah, this is super common.
1677000	1683000	They just say stupid things and the other person says something stupid in return.
1683000	1689000	Obviously. That's true, for example. Obviously. See, this is not how we talk.
1689000	1695000	What, he asked? The state we have described.
1695000	1702000	Sounds also like the Unatal limit. Y-O-N-E-D-A.
1702000	1707000	Seems to me to be genuinely wise for its judgment as good, isn't it? Yes.
1707000	1714000	And the quality of good judgment is clearly a form of, I have to change the page, knowledge.
1714000	1719000	As it is because of knowledge and not because of ignorance that we judge well.
1719000	1723000	Clearly. See, there's what I'm calling a stupid thing.
1723000	1727000	You don't say clarity is something that is completely not clear.
1727000	1731000	The quality of good judgment is clearly, it's just because he had said the word clearly,
1731000	1736000	so we're seeing kind of echopalaglossalalia or echolalia.
1736000	1739000	The person's just repeating a kind of word that they heard before.
1739000	1742000	They think that the other person wants them to hear.
1742000	1746000	And the quality of good judgment is clearly a form of knowledge.
1746000	1750000	As it is because of knowledge and not because of ignorance that we judge well.
1750000	1754000	Clearly. Well, there we go. Maybe. That's fine.
1754000	1760000	Because it's actually a kind of tautology where it is defining judgment as knowledge.
1760000	1767000	Just finding good knowledge. Dividing good judgment as knowledge.
1767000	1771000	And defining it as being the opposite of ignorance.
1771000	1779000	So clearly just is repeated back the kind of sound that he probably said most loud in the sentence.
1779000	1786000	And the most long he said, and the quality of good judgment is clearly a form of knowledge.
1786000	1790000	As it is because of knowledge and not because of ignorance that we judge well.
1790000	1794000	Clearly. Would be the response.
1794000	1798000	But there are many different kinds of knowledge in our city.
1798000	1803000	Of course there are. And do we have to say?
1803000	1807000	And do we say it has wisdom and judgment because of the knowledge of its carpentries?
1807000	1811000	Certainly not. That really makes it good at carpentry.
1811000	1816000	And so it's not wise because of its knowledge of woodwork and the excellence of its designs.
1816000	1822000	No. The same is presumably true of bronze and other materials. The same is true.
1822000	1827000	He said, so now I have to interject because it suddenly makes me think about the physicality of mind.
1827000	1834000	And do we need embodied intelligence? Not if unembodied things can think.
1834000	1839000	And I expect you would agree that knowledge affirming merely makes it good at agriculture.
1839000	1845000	So this is an argument why we should not kill robots.
1845000	1851000	Because they are living things on a different substrate that calculate.
1851000	1858000	And calculate here means to retacinate a reason.
1858000	1863000	And that's why I'm leaving.
1863000	1868000	The same is true, he said. And I would expect you would agree that knowledge affirming merely makes it good at agriculture.
1868000	1872000	Yes. And there it is.
1872000	1883000	That's from Plato, the Republic, Justice in State and Individual.
