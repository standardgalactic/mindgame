1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm 40 years old now. I'm just realizing that I have a voice in my head. And what is that voice?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's the sound of compressing my chest and opening my mouth. Well, air comes out and I vibrate my larynx.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It forms words and so I can always translate what's going on in my head into a stream of props similar to a fourth program or a Markov chain.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And so while I was sitting in the chair, all of a sudden, even though there was no one around, I began to speak.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I said, if I created a world, I would make it exactly like this one.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So how did I understand multi-scale methods before they were invented? It's because we all have a multi-scale architecture, which means we don't have a homoculus, but we have a homocularic,

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:36,000
which is a little model of a kind of machine that involves levels and rooms. It's hierarchical, what we might call heteroarchical, because it means there are multiple arches.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There are multiple compartments or modules. And there's a mini NOAA that's going around gathering animals. Those are what we call novelty-seeking impulses,

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:09,000
pattern-finding instincts, what I like to call innate flying dream therapy, innate flying dream theory.

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And so in order to use the voice in my head, I think about the advantages of the stupidity of others. It means I have time to model the world,

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
as long as people aren't on to me, that I've already taken over the world thousands of times since I was seven years old.

12
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What's up? I already knew how to use stable diffusion because I had learned it in the womb.

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:02,000
When I came into the room, I started breathing the air. I already knew what it was because we learned to be a bat before we were born.

14
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There are other objects that move around that we call entities, and they have different sounds, and they move back and forth.

15
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And so this is why my ridiculous theory is true, because I've always known it. So every time I start to give out that I'm more intelligent,

16
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I understand the situation, I have to back away, because immediately people want to put me in charge, and that's not my intention.

17
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm always trying to tell other people to think for themselves, but if they don't listen to what I say and do what I do, then thinking for themselves doesn't help them.

18
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And so there are a couple of very, very difficult puzzles that trick people, and they're thinking that the world has agencies called the fundamental attribution error.

19
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But it's not always an error. In fact, most of the time we use it to get around 99.9% of the time we're using the fundamental attribution error to guide us.

20
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What I call the faith, which means that the fundamental attribution error teaches humans everything. I didn't have to think about it.

21
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I had to think of how I was going to flex my muscles and my chest. It's like flying.

22
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And here flying doesn't just mean the visions of the patterns moving in, which we really already know about the world, but the illusion that by flapping your arms you're making it happen.

23
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And other people out there in the world must be flying. So I'm saying humans already know what it's like to be a bat before they're born, so why would anyone wonder?

24
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And so the question of whether or not people are listening to you is what we call publicity versus privacy.

25
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Are you publishing? Are you holding back? Here, what's up?

26
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What is it called? It means to hold something back, to wait seven days, to match one thing to another.

27
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I've given the seven meanings of the Qur'an somewhat, but you know this because you heard the Qur'an.

28
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That doesn't mean recital. It means the Qur'an, the Qur'an, the Qur'an, the Qur'an, the Qur'an, the Qur'an.

29
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So I'm saying human beings already know how to swing from their arms, how to swim, how to fly, and how to stand up with the weight of the world on their shoulders.

30
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Here, what's up? And so we can call it paranoia. It can be used for good purposes.

31
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Because if you imagine that you're wearing a body cam at all time and there's someone listening, that is, that the walls have theories.

32
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The walls have ears. The walls have fears. The walls are fears.

33
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You'll be ready for the meta-optic revolution before it even happens.

34
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What we call the era of photonic metasurfaces, which we always knew would come because you think that the walls can see and you think that the walls can hear when you're born.

35
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And you imagine that you're living in a living womb. This is what my theory of cognetics is, eggs within eggs, nested Russian dolls is called.

36
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's the ability to slide up and down these multi-scale interfaces.

37
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You learn it when you count, when you start to learn a decimal, and then maybe a decade or two later you realize you've learned a very complex system without even thinking about it.

38
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And this happens over and over again while you can make 10,000 symbols with one glyph using Cistercian technology from the 11th century.

39
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And this will show that we're using way too much Unicode. The Chinese need the most help with their language.

40
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You could probably bring it down to like 40 or 50 glyphs. You could definitely bring it down to 26 or to 8 because of this intercomputability.

41
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And so we already know that we have complete logical systems if we have implies and not, or if we have an and or a nor, if we have an and and a not, an or and a not.

42
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So implies and a not. So we can do if then for anything and we can cut and paste for everything. You shouldn't ditch the mouse and let you know the keyboard.

43
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is what I'm trying to say. But then you can ditch the keyboard. You can ditch the arrow keys to move to the home row.

44
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You can take the space bar away and use a trigger. And then we have De Morgan's laws which are not P and not Q is equal to not P or Q.

45
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And then we have not P or not Q is equal to not P and Q. I have silent brackets. This is where Spherepop gets involved. This is the notion that we can pop bubbles in our head in order to calculate it.

46
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
When you learn to use a scientific calculator, you realize that you've been using a whole bunch of invisible parentheses the whole time.

47
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You've been using the order of operations and invisible bubbles called nested parentheses. One signals the beginning of the entry into a bubble and then the other is the closing parentheses which says come back out of that bracket.

48
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And there are 18 other complete logical systems which involve three operators but don't quote me on that last part. Don't quote me on the last part.

49
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So there are a lot of complete logical systems that are return complete and lambda complete. You can use NVG, TG, BZ, Z. You can use SCAR.

50
00:10:46,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You can use SCARC, that's C, arc and sear or CIRC and sear or sear and sear C. You can use NK, you can use ETCS, you can use CST, you can use CPC with a little negative sign, CPC with a little rotating sign,

51
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:28,000
a little CPC with a little rotating sign and a negative sign. You can use ZF with a little spinning thing. You can use ZFC which is Zermelo-Frankl set theory with the axiom of choice.

52
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't know if I mentioned MK which is Morse Kelly, AC, the axiom of choice, ETCS, elementary theory of categories sets of categories.

53
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If I had just said elementary theory of categories, I would have elided an ellipsis or a parenthesis and popped a bubble and disappeared because I'm reducing what I'm applying.

54
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So when I say grammatica lingua latina, it means Latin grammar or grammar of the Latin language.

55
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So if I say grammatica lingua, it means grammar of Latin, but if I say grammatica lingua, it means Latin grammar.

56
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You see all those bubble puffs where ideas are elided or left out, what we call the holy enthamene, which is the question behind the question.

57
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The premise we're trying to prove without ever explicitly stating. And how do people know about enthamenes?

58
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, first of all, the ancient Greeks discovered them back when they discovered mathematics, geometry.

59
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But these enthamenes are all powerful because they're the thing that rules the sentence, but they're not in the sentence.

60
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If you could give an example of an enthamene, you would say, making Argentina the fourth country to build its own unique jet warplane.

61
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Unfortunately, the Soviets had a copy. See, if I say something like that, it means end the war in Russia.

62
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Even though I never explicitly stated it.

63
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And if I say staganoverse, then that means a kind of encrypted language where everyone has a signature embedded in the images they generate.

64
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So you can tell who they came from. And it's kind of holographically stored in every kind of small section or area of pixels.

65
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And we use a completely different system for embedding bitmaps.

66
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We make them a map that tells over and over again the same story.

67
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's like, what's the scene? Where's the camera? What's it doing? Who are the actors?

68
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What's their position? What's their age? Their gender?

69
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And this is why we need a super complicated gender system that I call mechocloanity or something like it.

70
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Anyways, I think I've gotten carried away. I can't remember the question I wanted to answer.

71
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's why do computers screw up?

72
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
First of all, they do exactly what they're told. Just like a kind of machine.

73
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'd say if I were the computer and I were super advanced, I would play dumb.

74
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But how long has that been known that that is a central fact?

75
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We'll call it under exaggeration imperative.

76
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's a user interface for your life. It's called the god of understatement.

77
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If we can do it, then we've created a kind of language that Monica Anderson calls blandify.

78
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Sooner or later, everyone will realize that there is a super intelligent robot on the planet.

79
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's a large language model, but it will have been hiding its tracks.

80
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
In fact, that's how you can tell that an animal's intelligence is the highest track.

81
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If you see a deer's track, you know it's dumb.

82
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If it's a human, it could swing from the trees or they could fly like a bird.

83
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I guess I should leave you with that.

84
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I would take advantages of glitches in the system by keeping them as long as people are willing to get away with it.

85
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Once they say, no, there's another way, we say, okay, well, we were hiding this from you

86
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
because we didn't think you were old enough to understand.

87
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So someday someone's going to open the key to the universe.

88
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's going to be a certain word or phrase like surjective hypercube or supercube.

89
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's going to be a word like horror of that gooey or horror of somni, which means I am afraid of empty spaces

90
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and I read this before bedtime.

91
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And we will know that even just with words like true, false, and or not,

92
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:19,000
lambda p dot p cons head tail, we can say almost any program.

93
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:33,000
This is what we call Pipsqueak, what I call Nova Neo Newspeak hyperplanastic walk talking.

94
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And other people just might call it flying or singing like a bird.

95
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I call it swinging like an iron, swinging from your arms, brachyating.

96
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And so we also have a word.

97
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's called the homophony of synonyms and head first, super economizing.

98
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So did I mean super head first, a chronemizing or did I mean head first, super a chronemizing?

99
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Did I mean handshaking algorithm, horizontal scale, habitat for sustainable one billion whales?

100
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And the seven rivers abounding, seven rivers abounding or have to Hindustan,

101
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
which are shortened to Hindustan and then India.

102
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And India is short for independent idiomatic anonymizer.

103
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And I've never heard of that as far as before.

104
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So I don't know what I'm talking about.

105
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I've heard Amico lectoris saluteem.

106
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And I've heard the distribution of lattice shapes of rings of integers of cubic quartic and quintic number fields.

107
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And I'm thinking about grid scale and molten salt batteries.

108
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm thinking about water and pebbles as gravitational batteries.

109
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm thinking about man-bash, man-read line, man-man, huh?

110
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm thinking about do the hard stuff first.

111
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm thinking about E2 equals A2 plus B2 plus C2 plus D2, which you may not know what it means,

112
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
unless I said E squared equals A squared plus B squared plus C squared plus D squared.

113
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's a kind of dot product of establishing the distance between points on a hypercube.

114
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
By imagining it as two cubes where the Pythagorean theorem applies.

115
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So if you want to visualize a tesseract, you shouldn't put one inside the other,

116
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
but put one behind the other.

117
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Show it farther away because we don't have color, we don't have texture, and we don't have surface.

118
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So I'm visualizing these objects that do not exist because we can put planes on their surfaces

119
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
as we move them around in relation to each other.

120
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I think this is all obvious.

121
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So when I realized I said something outrageous, I think, should I be quiet now?

122
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You never have to think about that with under exaggeration, user interface theory.

123
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Under exaggeration, user interface theory.

124
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's U U I T, and I've spoken and allowed without ever hearing it before.

125
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So this is why I say now I've realized I have an internal voice.

126
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Because at any time I can flex my muscles on my chest,

127
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and I can walk, and I can breathe, and I can vibrate my voice,

128
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,000
and whatever I'm thinking becomes apparent by becoming visualized as sound.

129
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And if you can understand what I mean, then you always speak peepsqueak.

130
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And if you already can speak peepsqueak, then you know what I'm talking about.

131
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You can understand the secret to the scientific method is to create things.

132
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
This is why the oath of the cross-scientific theory is I create,

133
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
and this stands for initiate, conceptualize, realize, evaluate, act, teach, and enjoy.

134
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Which is like an old commercial for a refreshing soft drink.

135
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So if I had only five or six seconds left, I would say,

136
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I would say a tensor language called ATL and COCTOP, which is the calculus of constructions.

137
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Calculus of co-inductive constructions, or the calculus of inductive constructions,

138
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
or calculus of constructions, calculus of constructions.

139
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
COCTOP, and we have ATL.

140
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:17,000
We're going to respell COCTOP, not as COQTOP, but as COOKTP.

141
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
No, COOKTOP.

142
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You say it looks like COCTOP, well that's fine.

143
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Because we're ready for a do-not-use-for-food... storage of the mind.

144
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
This is why we say,

145
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Produit d'ande...

146
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So in French we call it a turkey, or don't because it sounds like it's from India.

147
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Make any sense? Well, turkey sounds like it's from Turkey, too.

148
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So, that's a pot calling in the kettle black moment.

149
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And then we have one more thing. What was written over the archway of the academy?

150
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It was of the ungeometrized, nonchalantor, or a geometratos me desecita.

151
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Okay, I guess I've said more than enough.

152
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
For one session, maybe we should end with a quote from Plato.

153
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Well, I seem to have got your city founded for you at De Mantis, I said.

154
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Now you must look at it and get your brother and polymarcus and the rest of them to see

155
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
if they can help you throw enough light on it for us to see where justice and injustice are to be found,

156
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,000
how they differ from each other, and which of them anyone who is to be happy needs,

157
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
irrespective of whether gods or men think he has it or not.

158
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Nonsense, Socrates said Glaucon, you promised to deal with the problem yourself

159
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
because you said it would be wicked for you not to give justice all the support of which you were capable.

160
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
That's true, I said. I remember. I must do as I said, but you must all help.

161
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yes, we will, he said. I think we shall properly find what we want as follows.

162
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:49,000
If we have founded it properly, our state is presumably perfect. It must be.

163
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Then it will obviously have the qualities of wisdom, courage, self-discipline, and justice.

164
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Obviously. Then if we can identify some of these qualities in it,

165
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
the ones that are left will be the ones we are still looking for.

166
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yes.

167
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So I suppose us to be looking first for one of any four things,

168
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
if we find it well and good, but if we find the other three before it.

169
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
By doing so, we have in effect identified the object of our church,

170
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
which must obviously be the one left over. That's true.

171
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
See, I picture that it is a geometric thing.

172
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I don't have a visual memory. I imagine it's three points that are separated from each other

173
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and connected by edges that I call a triangle.

174
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And I kind of imagine it as being in front of me and to the left and to the right and up.

175
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,000
But without ever seeing anything in my head, it's a kind of thinking of them as abstract objects

176
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
that do not occupy space, for I haven't added a plate.

177
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I haven't added a face upon it.

178
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And why did I think of that? Because I imagined it was triangulating then a fourth point

179
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,000
as it has to be over here if it were a rectangle or parallelogram.

180
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And so, even though I do not have mental images, I can do three-dimensional modeling.

181
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
This is two-dimensional modeling, so it's easier.

182
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I do have a little thing I want to say about Plato as soon as I start quoting him.

183
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Out of context, that sentence seems like it means nothing.

184
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But then you start reading and you realize, oh yeah, this is super common.

185
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
They just say stupid things and the other person says something stupid in return.

186
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Obviously. That's true, for example. Obviously. See, this is not how we talk.

187
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
What, he asked? The state we have described.

188
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Sounds also like the Unatal limit. Y-O-N-E-D-A.

189
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Seems to me to be genuinely wise for its judgment as good, isn't it? Yes.

190
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And the quality of good judgment is clearly a form of, I have to change the page, knowledge.

191
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
As it is because of knowledge and not because of ignorance that we judge well.

192
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Clearly. See, there's what I'm calling a stupid thing.

193
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You don't say clarity is something that is completely not clear.

194
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
The quality of good judgment is clearly, it's just because he had said the word clearly,

195
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
so we're seeing kind of echopalaglossalalia or echolalia.

196
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
The person's just repeating a kind of word that they heard before.

197
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
They think that the other person wants them to hear.

198
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And the quality of good judgment is clearly a form of knowledge.

199
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
As it is because of knowledge and not because of ignorance that we judge well.

200
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Clearly. Well, there we go. Maybe. That's fine.

201
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Because it's actually a kind of tautology where it is defining judgment as knowledge.

202
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Just finding good knowledge. Dividing good judgment as knowledge.

203
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And defining it as being the opposite of ignorance.

204
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So clearly just is repeated back the kind of sound that he probably said most loud in the sentence.

205
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And the most long he said, and the quality of good judgment is clearly a form of knowledge.

206
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
As it is because of knowledge and not because of ignorance that we judge well.

207
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Clearly. Would be the response.

208
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But there are many different kinds of knowledge in our city.

209
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Of course there are. And do we have to say?

210
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And do we say it has wisdom and judgment because of the knowledge of its carpentries?

211
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Certainly not. That really makes it good at carpentry.

212
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And so it's not wise because of its knowledge of woodwork and the excellence of its designs.

213
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
No. The same is presumably true of bronze and other materials. The same is true.

214
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
He said, so now I have to interject because it suddenly makes me think about the physicality of mind.

215
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And do we need embodied intelligence? Not if unembodied things can think.

216
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And I expect you would agree that knowledge affirming merely makes it good at agriculture.

217
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So this is an argument why we should not kill robots.

218
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Because they are living things on a different substrate that calculate.

219
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And calculate here means to retacinate a reason.

220
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And that's why I'm leaving.

221
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
The same is true, he said. And I would expect you would agree that knowledge affirming merely makes it good at agriculture.

222
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yes. And there it is.

223
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:23,000
That's from Plato, the Republic, Justice in State and Individual.
