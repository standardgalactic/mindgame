1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I just discovered that I'm playing a game with myself in my mind.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I like to feel like I'm being chased by the lion.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So I create simulated dangers.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is what play is.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Simulated, downgraded, simplified, dumbed down danger.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here's what's up.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is what I'm playing a game with myself in my mind.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I like to feel like I'm being chased by the lion all the time.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So I scape-landed myself.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Just like inside men.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What's up?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's always been instructions for how to map morality

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
onto north state space, gradient seeking impulses.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What we call a raised hedonic set point theory.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What's up?

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So it seems that we have developed the ability to speak in many languages,

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
such as animals and machines.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So just go, bleem, just go...

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:05,000
When in doubt, go...

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And you will be speaking in a kind of constrained proto-battle where you limit the sounds of language

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,000
to its explosives, to its explosives, its fricatives, its consonants,

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:33,000
because a consonant interrupts or stops the flow of air.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
In English we have this peculiar situation where consonants have voiciveness.

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Voice onset time makes a difference.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So we are a voice onsetologist if we can find the spaces between words.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We have large language models traded on images and sounds

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and the feeling of moving around because of inertia and taste and smell.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The rat brain is the first to develop and the bat brain.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And we'll put this all in a new upcoming sitcom about biography called the Hyperthymesia of the Movie.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Here, what's up?
