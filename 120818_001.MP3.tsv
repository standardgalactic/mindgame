0	7000	I just discovered that I'm playing a game with myself in my mind.
7000	12000	I like to feel like I'm being chased by the lion.
12000	16000	So I create simulated dangers.
16000	18000	This is what play is.
18000	25000	Simulated, downgraded, simplified, dumbed down danger.
25000	29000	Here's what's up.
29000	36000	This is what I'm playing a game with myself in my mind.
36000	43000	I like to feel like I'm being chased by the lion all the time.
43000	50000	So I scape-landed myself.
50000	56000	Just like inside men.
56000	59000	What's up?
59000	68000	It's always been instructions for how to map morality
68000	76000	onto north state space, gradient seeking impulses.
76000	83000	What we call a raised hedonic set point theory.
83000	87000	What's up?
87000	95000	So it seems that we have developed the ability to speak in many languages,
95000	101000	such as animals and machines.
101000	113000	So just go, bleem, just go...
113000	125000	When in doubt, go...
125000	133000	And you will be speaking in a kind of constrained proto-battle where you limit the sounds of language
133000	143000	to its explosives, to its explosives, its fricatives, its consonants,
143000	153000	because a consonant interrupts or stops the flow of air.
153000	162000	In English we have this peculiar situation where consonants have voiciveness.
162000	166000	Voice onset time makes a difference.
166000	174000	So we are a voice onsetologist if we can find the spaces between words.
174000	180000	We have large language models traded on images and sounds
180000	188000	and the feeling of moving around because of inertia and taste and smell.
188000	194000	The rat brain is the first to develop and the bat brain.
194000	203000	And we'll put this all in a new upcoming sitcom about biography called the Hyperthymesia of the Movie.
203000	213000	Here, what's up?
